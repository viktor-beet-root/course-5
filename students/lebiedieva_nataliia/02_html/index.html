            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am 23 years old. I was born in one of the major cities of Ukraine - Dnipro.
                The city is magnificent, yet quite a distinctive place that I still remember to this day.

                The stages of my life have been rather ordinary: childhood - school - university - job...
                which has transitioned into independent living.</p>
            <p><span><b>Short story about me.</b></span>I don't remember my childhood very vividly. <br>
                Our family was quite large - my mother, three sisters, and four brothers. During my school years, 
                I was involved in sports and participated in football and basketball competitions. <br>
                Later on, I began to pursue education and explore various fields of knowledge. <br>

                When I entered the University, my life changed drastically. 
                I started living in Kyiv and began studying technical sciences. Alongside that, I developed an interest in the art of photography, 
                which became my hobby. <br>I started perceiving life in a new way, aided by philosophy and scientific articles that I had the chance to read. 
                I made friends who have become my closest companions to this day.
                
                Due to my love for all things beautiful, aesthetics, and minimalism, <br>I developed an interest in web development. 
                I am taking gradual steps towards my goal.</p>
