                        React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using
                        React
                        and the app platform's native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access
                        your
                        platform's APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
                        components: <i>bundles of reusable, nestable code</i>. You can learn
                        more
                        about React in the next
                        section. But first, let's cover how components work in React Native.

                            React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for
                            building user interfaces with
                            JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This
                            section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
                        </p>
                        <p>We're going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                        <p><b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in
                            its examples: friendly,
                            approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                        <p><b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                            elements inside
                            JavaScript like so:
                            <br>
                            <span class="code">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The React docs have <i>a comprehensive guide to JSX</i> you can refer
                            to learn even more. Because
                            JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span
                                class="code">name</span> for the
                            cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="code">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
                        </p>
                        <p><b>+ props.</b> Props is short for “properties”.</p>
                        <p><b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to
                            configure how components render, state is like a component's personal data storage. State is
                            useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State
                            gives your components memory!</p>

                    <div class="main__chapter-text">
                        <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an
                            <i>onChangeText</i> prop
                            that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop
                            that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
                        </p>
                        <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a
                            different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: 🍕. So
                            the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "🍕 🍕".</p>
