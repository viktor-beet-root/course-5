                    <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
                        instructions, they've
                        moved to their own section. Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation, Native

                        more!</p>

                    <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React
                        and the app platform‚Äôs
                        native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well
                        as to describe the
                        appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <em>bundles of reusable, nestable
                            code</em>.
                        You can learn more about
                        React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                    <p>React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
                        JavaScript. To make the most
                        of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can
                        serve as a refresher
                        course.</p>
                    <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="rf-list_item"><strong>components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to React
                            uses cats in
                            its
                            examples: friendly, approachable creatures that
                            need names and a cafe to work in.</li>
                        <li class="rf-list_item"><strong>JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that
                            lets you
                            write
                            elements inside JavaScript like so: <br>
                            <span class="selected-text">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;.</span>

                            <p>The React docs have <span class="underline-text">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you
                                can refer to learn even more.
                                Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
                                <span class="selected-text">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding
                                it with curly braces inside<span class="selected-text">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="rf-list_item"><strong>props.</strong> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</li>
                        <li class="rf-list_item"><strong>state.</strong> While you can think of props as arguments you
                            use to
                            configure
                            how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs
                            personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that
                            comes from user interaction.
                            State gives your components memory!</li>

                    <h2 class="psevdo-line" id="handling-text-input">handling text input<sup>Chapter 4</sup></h2>
                    <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <em>onChangeText</em>
                        prop
                        that takes a function to
                        be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to
                        be called when the text is
                        submitted.</p>
                    <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a
                        different language. In this new
                        language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob"
                        would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
